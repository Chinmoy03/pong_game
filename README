A few notes for the code:
- The application is a general pong game against the wall
- Scoreboard has not been added 
- If one looks at the commented out section in the code, one can see that there is an option for a paddle on the right side. However, multiple events cannot take place at the same time.
This means that two paddles cannot be operated at the same time given the current resources used in the code.
- To tackle this problem, the right side edge of the window has been made to deflect the ball so that the player can keep playing.
